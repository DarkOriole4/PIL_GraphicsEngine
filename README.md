# PIL_GraphicsEngine
A 2D/3D graphics engine built entirely from scratch, using my very limited knowledge of raster rendering and the Python Image Library (PIL)

I don't usually use github, or make my code public, but I want a way to easily manage my code and thought that maybe someone else could use it too.
So feel free to take it if you want, make it run faster or something - as long as you keep it open source I won't mind
